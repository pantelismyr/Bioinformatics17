To get the given genomes we do the following:
Browse in the homepage of NCBI -> Genomes (Top bar)-> Genome (Genome Sequences)->
Browse by Organism (Using Genome) -> SEARCH FOR THE GIVEN GENOME ON THE SEARCH BAR ->
Download sequences in FASTA format for genome

(shortcut: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/)

Note that through this page we can bowse the list for all renomes for species but we need to 
check that we actualy download the chromosomal genome sequences and NOT the plasmid etc.!

Then we need to change the extention of the file to .fasta (or copy paste the sequence from
the site (assuming we choose fasta format) and paste it in a plain text editor and save it as fasta)
